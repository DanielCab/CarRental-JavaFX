<h1> Welcome to Car Rental and Associates Java Application user manual. </h1>

<ul>

<li>To begin using the application please make sure to first launch the "server.java" file, 
this begins the server and uses threads to also handle client socket requests in the same class. </li>

<br>

<li>This will start the connection to the server where the usename and password are stored for authentication. ( username and password are user and pass ) </li>

<br>

<li>Once launched you may continue to launch the app.java main file ( view in the Model View Controller pattern ) to login and begin using the application. </li>


<br>

<li>There you will be greeted with CRUD ( create , read , update and delete) functionality for interacting with the database for car rentals. </li>

<br>

<li>When a car is created, updated or deleted it will be updated within the MySql database (which you must create, sql code will be provided.) </li>

<br>

<li>"Reading" or accessing the database simply retuns the values which you have added to the database. </li>

<br>

<li>All changes are made and saved upon using the submit buttons, closing the program without submitting will result in changes not being saved. </li>
